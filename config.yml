  Our lab uses molecular simulations to understand and design functional soft materials, 
  with global sustainability and health challenges in mind. We work at the intersection 
  of molecular simulations, machine learning, and information theory to discover and
  design tunable organization, structure, and function.

# Prospectives
prospective_students:
  paragraph1: >
    We are currently seeking motivated graduate and undergraduate students interested in modeling polypeptides and colloids with approaches that utilize machine learning and information theory. Students should have a strong background and interest in the physical sciences and mathematics. Previous experience in computer programming or molecular simulation is helpful but not required.
  
  paragraph2: >
    Graduate students currently in a Ph.D. program at Rutgers are encouraged to contact Prof. Guo by email to discuss potential opportunities in the lab and research interests. Prospective CBE graduate students are encouraged to reach out as well and should apply to the <a href="https://cbe.rutgers.edu/admissions/graduate-cbe">CBE program</a>. Undergraduate students interested in joining the group are welcome to inquire about opportunities in the group by emailing Prof. Guo with a copy of their CV that includes relevant coursework.
