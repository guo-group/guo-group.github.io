  Our lab uses molecular simulations to understand and design functional soft materials, 
  with global sustainability and health challenges in mind. We work at the intersection 
  of molecular simulations, machine learning, and information theory to discover and
  develop tunable organization, structure, and function.

# Prospectives
prospective_students:
  paragraph1: >
    We are seeking curious and motivated students who are interested in data- and information-driven 
    modeling of biomolecules, polymers, and colloids. Students should have a strong background and 
    interest in the physical sciences and mathematics. Previous experience in computer programming 
    or molecular simulation is helpful but not required.
  
  paragraph2: >
    Current and prospective Ph.D. students are encouraged to contact Prof. Guo directly to discuss 
    potential opportunities and research interests. Prospective graduate students should apply to the 
    <a href="https://cbe.rutgers.edu/admissions/graduate-cbe">Rutgers CBE program</a>. Highly motivated
    undergraduates are welcome to inquire about opportunities by emailing Prof. Guo with a copy 
    of their CV and details on their relevant completed coursework.
